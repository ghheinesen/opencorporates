# opencorporates
Proof of concept implementation of a library and a client for accessing OpenCorporates' API in Python.

The goal of this project is to develop a python library that can be used to access 
OpenCorporates' API [http://api.opencorporates.com/documentation/API-Reference](http://api.opencorporates.com/documentation/API-Reference)
and, in addition, a reference implementation of a client that uses this library.
